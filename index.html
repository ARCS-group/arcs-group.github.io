<p> The Artificial Intelligence for Robot Coordination at Scale (ARCS) Lab at the
    <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Robotics Institute</a>
    brings together researchers to address the challenges of multi-robot collaboration.
    Our research focuses on developing planning and learning methods for
    large teams of autonomous agents to accomplish collaborative tasks intelligently in dynamic environments.
